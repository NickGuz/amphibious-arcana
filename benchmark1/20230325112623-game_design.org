* Introduction
This document describes a game called “FrogWizard’s Odyssey”. It is a 2D side scrolling, platformer game. The game will employ a variety of bosses which will allow the player to acquire new abilities for them to use in the remainder of their quest.

* Technology
FrogWizard’s Odyssey will be developed using the Wolfie 2D game engine. Music will be created using [Music/Audio program] and sound effects will be created from Chiptone. Sprites and other artworks will be created through piskel or taken from the existing Sprites page.

* Backstory
[Name] is a wizard. He lives in a village full of other wizards. One night, an evil wizard launches a surprise attack on his village. The evil wizard steals the power of all the wizards and turns them into frogs. [Name] is the only one that is strong enough to travel long distances after being turned into a frog. He vows to track down the evil wizard and take back the powers of the wizards in his village.

* Objective
[Name] journeys across the land searching for traces of the evil wizard. He comes across many powerful enemies that might’ve been the evil wizard’s minions. After defeating each powerful enemy, he regains one of the powers he has lost. Eventually, with some of his power back, he needs to defeat the evil wizard at the end and turn everyone back to normal.

* Gameplay
The game will be a side scroller with a mixture of vertical and horizontal platforming. There will also be boss fights at the end of every 2 levels.

[Name] has multiple abilities he can use to attack and move around:
- Tongue swinging/grappling/attacking
- Fireballs can be thrown at enemies or thrown underneath [Name] to propel him forward in the air
- Ice Blast can be used to freeze enemies into blocks of ice [Name] can jump on, or for just stunning larger enemies

The game will have 6 levels.
- Levels 1 & 2 will allow the player to get used to movement and combat using just the tongue ability. The boss fight at the end of level 2 will focus on close range combat. After killing this boss, the player will unlock the Fireball spell.
- Levels 3 & 4 will now allow the player to use fireballs to attack enemies, as well as use the fireball explosions to propel them across the level during the platforming. The boss fight at the end of level 4 will focus on longer range combat. After killing this boss, the player will unlock the Ice Blast spell.
- Levels 5 & 6 will now allow the player to shoot ice at enemies to freeze and stun them in place. Smaller enemies will turn into ice blocks which the player can jump on to aid in traversing the level. The boss fight at the end of level 6 combines everything the player has learned so far. After killing this boss, the game ends and the player has won.
